# OOP (You Down?)
## Basic Terms
* Object - an instance of a class; everything is an object
* Class - template (cookie cutter) used to construct objects including all attributes and methods
* Attribute - a variable inside the class
* Method - a function within a class and all objects of that class' type

## Look at one in the wild!
```python
from datetime import date

today = date.today()
type(today)
dir(today)
```
After going through that in the debugger, ctrl+click on today() and briefly show the class

## Let's make one!!!
make a person class with some attributes

make a person object and assign some values to the attributes

add a method

make a person, assign some values, and call the method

## More Terms
* inheritance
* parent class
* child class

## Let's make one!!!
make an employee class that inherits from person with some attributes that reflect their employeeness

make an employee objects and check out all of those attributes!!! ...and method

add a method

make the employee, etc.

## More terms???
* constructor (init)
* destructor (not frequently used; python keeps things pretty clean for us)

## Let's use it on a new person class!!!!!!!!!11
